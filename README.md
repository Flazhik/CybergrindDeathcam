Ever wonder what the hell has just killed you in Cyber Grind? Sometimes it's hard keeping track on things like this with a ton of projectiles flying around.
This mod enables TF2-like camera upon death in Cyber Grind mode, allowing to see what's killed you.

Please note that it doesn't track dead enemies.

## Leaderboards skip (Optional feature)
If you're willing to skip the leaderboards sequence at the end of your run and get back to the Terminal room ASAP,
you can enable Leaderboards skip in **Options** > **Plugin config** > **CybergrindDeathcam**

When enabled, this feature will restart CG almost instantly upon your death.

You could also notice two other parameters there:

**Don't skip if PB is <= N waves away**: if the difference between the wave you've just reached and your personal best is
lower than this value, the leaderboards sequence will still be played

**Don't skip starting from wave**: if the value of the wave you've just reached exceeds this value,
Leaderboards sequence will be played unconditionally and will never be skipped
